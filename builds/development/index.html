					<h4>United States Patent #4511291</h4>
					 When I was involved in the offshore oil and gas services industry, we were hindered by the size of abrasive blasting pressure vessels that could be used on marine vessels.  We needed a way to use bulk quantities of abrasives. I designed, built, and tested prototypes until I had a device that would solve the problem. This system temporarily converted bulk abrasive blasting pressure vessels into vacuum vessels that could draw abrasives from bulk containers for refilling. This reduced the crew size by 35 percent.  Abrasive material costs were lowered by using bulk truck loads. We increased productivity by more than 200 percent by reducing downtime waiting on the refills of the small abrasive pressure vessels. Information on the patent can be found at google patent site:

            In order to stay current with emerging technologies I have been taking advantage of online training services such as Lynda.com, Pluralsight, Code School and others. I have completed more than 35 software related courses from Lynda.com and about 24 courses from Pluralsight. I have completed 40 of these courses in 2016 alone.
          </p>
          <p class="training">
            Recently, I have taken advantage of extra time away from consulting to work on new technologies and fundamentals and then applying this training to real projects. I am finding that many of the frameworks and languages that I avoided in the past are actually enjoyable. The structure and simplicity provided by tools like "Ruby on Rails", "React and Redux", and even MVC, are making my life easier and more organized.
          </p>
          <p class="training">
             My coding style has changed now that I have taken the time to learn, in-depth, the foundations and fundamentals of many of the development tools and techniques that in the past I ascertained only "by example". I can now use tools like MVC with confidence, and without the prejudices that were hindering me in the past.
